I can't tell you what it really is,
I can only tell you what it feels like,
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe but i still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in fight
High off of love, drunk from my hate
Its like i'm huffin' paint i love it the more I suffer, I suffocate
And just before I'm about to drown , she resucitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it
Wait! Where're you going?
I'm leaving you, No you ain't 
Come back, we're runnin' right back here we go again
its so insane cuz when it's going good its going great
I'm superman with the wind at his back, She's lois lane
But when its bad its awful I feel so ashamed 
I snapped who's that dude
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again
Guess I don't know my own strength..

You ever love somebody so much
you can barely breathe when you with 'em 
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em 
got that warm fuzzy feeling 
yeah those chills you used to get 'em 
now you're gettin fucking sick of lookin' at 'em
you's swear you'd never hit 'em
never do nothing to hurt 'em
now you're in each other's face spewing venom
in your words when you spit 'em
you push pull each others' hair 
scratch claw hit 'em
throw 'em down pin 'em 
so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
Its the rage that took over it
controls you both
so they say you're best to go your seperate ways
guess if they didn't know you
cuz today that was yesterday
yesterday is over 
its a different day
sounds like broken records playing over
but you promised her
next time you'd show restraint
you don't get another chance
life is no nintendo game
but you lied again
now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane

now I know we said things did things that we didn't mean
and we fall back into the same patterns
same routines 
but your temper's just as bad as mine is
you're same as me 
when it comes to love you're just as blinded
baby please come back
it wasn't you
baby it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is I love you too much
to walk away though
come inside
pick up your bags up the side walk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball 
next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
next time. There will be no next time
i apologise even though i know it's lies
I'm tired of the games I just want her back 
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again
i'ma tie to the bed and set this house on fire..
